This project, titled **"Ensuring Resilient and Confidential Data Transmission with AI in Ad Hoc Networks,"** focuses on securing communication in decentralized, infrastructure-less environments such as Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). These networks are often used in critical scenarios like disaster zones, military operations, and remote sensing where traditional infrastructure is unavailable. The primary aim is to enhance **data confidentiality and resilience** using **Artificial Intelligence techniques**. Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and Artificial Neural Networks are employed to detect anomalies, identify potential threats like black hole or wormhole attacks, and ensure dynamic trust-based routing. A secure encryption layer using AES or RSA further ensures that data remains protected during transmission. The system continuously analyzes real-time network parameters—like packet drop rate, delay, throughput, and node mobility—to make intelligent decisions on secure and reliable routing paths. When a threat or failure is detected, the AI model adapts the routing strategy to avoid compromised nodes and reroute data through more trusted paths, improving overall **network resilience**. The project integrates security, AI-driven adaptability, and fault-tolerant communication strategies into a single framework to enable robust and confidential data transfer in highly dynamic and unpredictable network conditions.
